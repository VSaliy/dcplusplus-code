This folder contains a few scripts from po4a <https://www.po4a.org/> used for translating help
files. We only need the XHTML module.

Patches in the "patches" directory have been applied.

Note: these are Perl scripts, so a Perl installation is necessary. Before calling them, make sure
the "lib" sub-folder of this directory is in the Perl include path (call with -I or set perllib).
