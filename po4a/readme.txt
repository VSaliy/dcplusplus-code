This folder contains a few scripts from po4a <http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/> used for translating
help files. We only need the XHTML module.

Current version: 0.35.

Note: these are Perl scripts, so a Perl installation is necessary. Before calling them, make sure
the "lib" sub-folder of this directory is in the Perl include path (call with -I or set perllib).
