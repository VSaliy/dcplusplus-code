<h1>Waiting users</h1>
<p>
This page will display those users who have queued a file from you, but haven't been able to get a slot. As well, from which hub they originate,
the file that they've queued and how much of the file they have completed.
</p>
<p>
Note that this is not an upload queue, and just a visual representation of who have tried to get a slot for what.
