  	</li>
  	<li><p><i>User(s) offline</i></p>
  		<p>It means that no sources are currently online for this file. You should wait until at least one goes online or you can search for additional alternate sources for this file by selecting the appropriate menu command from the context menu.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li><p><i>Finished</i></p>

   <ul>
  	<li><p><i>File not available</i></p>
  		<p>The file cannot be downloaded from the source at the moment. Either the user's filelist was outdated when this file was added to the queue or the user removed the file from his/her share since then.</p>
  	</li>	
  	<li><p><i>Passive user</i></p>
  		<p>You can get this error only if you are in <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">Passive connection mode</a>. The client of the given source is in passive mode, either and two <a href="faq_whyactive.html">passive users cannot download from each other</a>. The source will be used automatically if at least one of the peers <a href="faq_whyactive.html">switches to Active mode</a>.</p>
  	</li>	
  	<li><p><i>CRC32 inconsistency (SFV-Check)</i></p>
  	<p>The file was downloaded but its CRC32 checksum does not match the checksum stored in an accompanying .sfv file. The file will be redownloaded from another source. You can disable this integrity check with the corresponding checkbox in <a href="settings_advanced.html#sfvcheck">Advanced settings</a>.</p>
  	</li>	
	<li><p><i>Full tree does not match TTH root</i></p>
		<p>The source provided wrong or corrupted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_tree" target="_blank" class="external">Tiger tree</a> for the file. This can caused by connection problems or hashdata corruption (at one or both peers).</p>
	</li>	
	<li><p><i>No full tree available</i></p>
		<p>None of the sources provided the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_tree" target="_blank" class="external">Tiger tree</a> for this large file and as long as the full tree is not available DC++ cannot resume this file. You can readd the source(s) manually and let DC++ download the file without having the hash tree information at your own risk.</p>
	</li>	
  	<li><p><i>Source too slow</i></p>
  		<p>The source is dropped because it meets one ore more criteria defined in your <a href="settings_queue.html#autodrop">Autodrop settings</a>.</p>
  	</li>	
  	<li><p><i>Remote client does not fully support TTH - cannot download</i></p>
  		<p>The source using an old or unsupported client.</p>
  	</li>	
  	<li><p><i>User certificate not trusted</i></p>
  		<p>You have set in <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates settings</a> that your client should only accept sources with trusted certificates. This source is not trusted so it'll be excluded from downloads.</p>

  		<p>You have set in <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates settings</a> that your client should only accept sources with TLS encrypted connections. This source does not seem to have an encrypted connection so it'll be excluded from downloads.</p>
