<h1>How to set up connection manually?</h1>

<p>In most cases DC++ should be able to automatically detect the appropriate
connection method. This FAQ gives detailed information how to set up
your incoming connection manually in case of the <a href="settings_connectivity.html">
automatic detection</a> fails or its result isn't acceptable for you.</p>

<p>Note that correct incoming connection settings are needed for searches and
downloads to work. These settings have no effect on ability to connecting to hubs
or downloading hublists. Before you go on with this FAQ make sure that you are
able to download hublists and connect to hubs. If not then please follow 
<a href="get_started.html#firewall">this guide</a> instead.</p>

<p>To get the most out of DC++ you should find out what is the best connection
mode for you. From a protocol perspective, there are two connection methods available:
<b>active mode</b> and <b>passive mode</b>. While passive mode is almost guaranteed
to work, it does not work as well as a properly configured active mode connection.
For a more in-depth explanation, read <a href="faq_whyactive.html">
Why do I need active mode?</a></p>

<p>It is very important to decide what <i>active connection mode</i> is available
for you. It depends on your network structure, so you need to know exactly how
you access the Internet. Is it a direct connection through a modem or do you
have a local network and access the Internet through a router or other gateway?
If unsure, <a href="http://www.b.ali.btinternet.co.uk/DCPlusPlus/advancedUsage.html#activepassive" target="_blank" class="external">this page</a> 
should help you figure it out. </p>

<p>If you're still unsure what network devices you use to connect to the Internet,
then use <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Google</a>! It can give you
information on every network device you own, just by searching for the <u>model
number</u> printed on the device.  Many ISPs call their device a simple modem
when it is actually a router, so it never hurts to check.</p>

<p>In order to choose a proper active connection mode, you must know whether you
are <i>behind a router or gateway</i> or if you <i>access the Internet
directly</i>. You can also determine if you have a router or not by checking
your <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i> IP addresses. If these IP addresses
<b>do NOT match then you access the Internet through a local gateway or
router</b>.</p>

<ul> <li style="margin-left: 10px;">To see your <i>internal IP address</i> go
to the Windows Start menu, click Run... and type : cmd /k ipconfig</li>

<li style="margin-left: 10px;">To see your <i>external IP address</i> go to one
of the following websites : <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank" class="external">www.whatismyip.com</a>, <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/ip" target="_blank" class="external">www.dslreports.com/ip</a>, <a href="http://www.ip2location.com/" target="_blank" class="external">www.ip2location.com</a></li> 
</ul>

<p>If you are still unsure you may want to consult your ISP support hotline or
system administrator (if on an organization's network).</p>

<p>To manually configure your connectivity settings, uncheck <a href="settings_connectivity.html">
Enable automatic connection type detection</a> in the Connectivity settings pane of the settings
dialog. This will enable the whole <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">Manual configuration</a>
group which you can use to alter connectivity settings manually.</p>

<p>When you look at the <a href="settings_connectivity.html_manual#connection">Incoming connection settings</a>
you will find 3 options for active mode and the last option for being passive
as a last resort. For being active:</p>

<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 10px;">You can use the <i>My computer is directly connected 
to Internet (no router)</i> option <b>ONLY if you don't have a router/gateway</b>.

</li><li style="margin-left: 10px;">If you <b>have a router/gateway you can use ONLY
the 2nd or the 3rd option</b> : <i>Use UPnP to let DC++ configure
my router</i> or <i>Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)</i></li>

</ul>

<p>For setting up any of the three active mode options follow the <a href="faq_activemode.html">active mode setup FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>If none of the above helped or you are not able to use active mode in your
network (e.g. you have no access to the configuration page of the
router/gateway or you have firewall service provided by your ISP) then you must
choose <i>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</i> option in 
<a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html">Connection Settings</a>. As linked above,
however, passive mode has several disadvantages.</p>
