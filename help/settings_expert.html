  <dt>Max hash speed</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MAX_HASH_SPEED">This is the speed at which DC++ will hash your files, in
MiB/s.
It is limited by the speed of your disk subsystem, but it can be
used to make hashing slower and less noticable. A "normal" hash
speed may be anywhere from 20 to 50 MiB/s.  (no default)</dd>
  <dt id="pmhistory">PM history</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_PM_HISTORY">The number of lines that will be read from the private
message
log and displayed when a new PM is received. (no default)</dd>
  <dt id="minislotsize">Mini slot size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MINISLOT_SIZE">This defines the size of the <a href="settings_sharing.html#slots">mini slot</a>. The
minimum value for this setting is 64 KiB. (default: 64 KiB)</dd>
  <dt id="maxlistsize">Max filelist size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MAX_FILELIST_SIZE">This setting controls the size of the maximum file list
that DC++
will open, in mebibytes. This setting helps protect against
malformed file lists that require large amounts of memory to decode.
You may need to reduce or increase the value of this setting
based on personal experience. (default: 512 MiB)</dd>
  <dt>PID</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_PRIVATE_ID">This is your unique private ID (PID). This will later with an algorithm be used to identify you on ADC hubs. <b>Do not share this with other users.</b></dd>
  <dt id="autorefresh">Auto refresh time</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_AUTO_REFRESH_TIME">This controls the interval at which your shared directories
are rescanned for new and changed content. This is measured
in minutes. (default: 60 minutes)</dd>
  <dt>Write buffer size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_BUFFERSIZE">This controls the size of the chunks that DC++ writes to
disk for downloads. Measured in kibibytes. (default: 16 KiB)</dd>
  <dt id="autosearchlimit">Auto-search limit</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_AUTO_SEARCH_LIMIT">This will limit the amount of sources a file can have before it will no longer be auto searched for. For example, if this option is set to 2, if a file has more than or exactly 2 sources, the file will be excluded from the auto-search list.</dd>
  <dt id="searchhistory">Search history</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SEARCH_HISTORY">Number of old search lines that will be shown in the Search
Window. (default: 10)</dd>
  <dt>Bind address</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_BIND_ADDRESS">This setting allows you to bind DC++ to a particular IP
address
on your machine. Most users do not need to change the default value,
0.0.0.0. However, if you have more than one network interface
connected to the internet, you can force DC++ to use a particular
connection by entering its IP here. If binding fails, it will do
so silently and INADDR_ANY will be used instead. If you experience
connection problems make sure that this is set to default. (default:
0.0.0.0)<br/>
    <i> This feature
requires a restart to be fully effective.</i></dd>
  <dt>Socket read buffer</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SOCKET_IN_BUFFER">The size of the buffer DC++ use to read sockets. Measured
in bytes. (default: 8192 bytes)</dd>
  <dt id="writebuffer">Socket write buffer</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SOCKET_OUT_BUFFER">The size of the buffer DC++ use to write to sockets.
