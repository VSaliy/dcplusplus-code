<h2>Main chat window (left)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_HUB_CHAT">
The main chat window displays messages sent by the hub. You can chat with other users in this "public area" by writing a message in the field below the main chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available). You can right click to the users' nicks to bring up the user context menu described below.<br/>
Note; this is not the place to search for files. Open a <a href="window_search.html">Search window</a> to do that.<br/>
This window can be focused with Alt+C.
</p>

<h3>Main chat messages</h3>
<p>Messages destined to the status bar can also be shown in the main chat, depending on some
options in <a href="settings_appearance.html">Appearance settings</a>: one
<a href="settings_appearance.html#viewstatus">general option to have useful status messages sent
	to the main chat window</a> (enabled by default), and one
<a href="settings_appearance.html#filterkick">to control whether spam messages should also be
	considered useful</a>. Regardless of these settings, status messages are always shown in the
<a href="#statusbar">status bar of the hub window</a>.</p>
<p>Status messages are easy to spot: they start with three asterisks (&#42;&#42;&#42;); on the
other hand, normal messages generally contain a nick (either the name of an online user or a hub
bot) printed between &lt; and &gt;. A better description of the various status bar messages can be
found <a href="#messages">below</a>.</p>
<p>Click on links (URLs that start with https://, ftp://, www, etc) shown in the chat window to
open them with the registered browser/viewer software.</p>

<h2>Users list (right)</h2>
<p>
List of users connected to the hub. You can right-click them to see the menu options available for each.<br/>
<a href="faq_different_icons.html">Follow this link to see what the different icons mean</a>.<br/>
The users list can be shown or hidden by using the checkbox available in the bottom right of the hub window, in the status bar, right below the users list filter. When that checkbox is checked, the users list is shown.<br/>
This window can be focused with Alt+U.
