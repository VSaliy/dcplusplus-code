<h2>Main chat window (left)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_HUB_CHAT">
The main chat window displays messages sent by the hub. You can chat with other users in this "public area" by writing a message in the field below the main chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available). You can right click to the users' nicks to bring up the user context menu described below.<br/>
Note; this is not the place to search for files. Open a <a href="window_search.html">Search window</a> to do that.</p>

<h3>Main chat messages</h3>
<p>Using <a href="settings_appearance.html">Appearance settings</a> you can set what kind of messages should appear in the main chat window and how should they look like. It is possible to get <a href="settings_appearance.html#viewstatus">status messages printed also to the main chat window</a> (enabled by default) while there is a setting to <a href="settings_appearance.html#filterkick">filter out unwanted kick messages</a> as well. Note that status messages are <i>generated locally</i> so they aren't come from the hub. Regardless of the settings status messages are always shown in the <a href="#statusbar">status bar of the hub window</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily distinguish between status messages or the ones came from the hub: status messages are start with three asterisk (&#42;&#42;&#42;) while normal messages came from the hub usually contain a nick (either the name of an online user or a hubbot) printed between &lt; and &gt;. The possible kind of status messages are listed in the description of the status bar <a href="#messages">below</a>.</p>
<p>Double click to any registered URL type (http://, ftp://, etc...) shown in the main chat will open them in their respective registered browser/viewer software.</p>	

<h2>Users list (right)</h2>
List of users connected to the hub. You can right-click them to see the menu options available for each.<br/>
<a href="faq_different_icons.html">Follow this link to see what the different icons mean</a>.<br/>
The users list can be shown or hidden by using the checkbox available in the bottom right of the hub window, in the status bar, right below the users list filter. When that checkbox is checked, the users list is shown.
