<h2>Tabs</h2>
<p>Each window opened in DC++ has a corresponding tab, which appears in the global tab control.</p>
<p>Tabs in DC++ behave the same as in standard Windows applications; moreover, they have the
following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be moved around in a drag-and-drop fashion.</li>
<li>There are some easy ways to switch between them: with mouse extra buttons or using Ctrl+Tab.</li>
<li>When many tabs are opened, and they can't fit into a single row, they will automatically occupy more rows.</li>
<li>Each tab has its own context-menu which provides commands related to the window the tab belongs to. 
	Description of the common context menu options are listed in the <a href="general_menu_commands.html">
    General Menu Commands</a> page.</li>
<li>Tabs can be closed with: <ul>
<li>Middle mouse click</li>
<li>Shift + left mouse click</li>
<li>The &quot;Close&quot; command from the tab context-menu</li>
<li>Ctrl+W</li>
<li>Ctrl+F4</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
You can customize the look and behavior of tabs from the <a href="settings_tabs.html">Tabs settings</a> and
<a href="settings_windows.html">Windows settings</a> respectively.

<h2>Status bar (bottom)</h2>
The main status bar is always visible in the bottom of the DC++ window. You can get information from the current state of several parameters of DC++ here. The status bar is divided into sections for better visibility. Their meaning from left to right:
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <dt>System messages</dt>
    <dd cshelp="IDH_MAIN_STATUS">The first part of the status bar contains the last system message with a timestamp. To see more from the recent system messages you can move the mouse pointer above the statusbar - the last 10 lines of the messages will be shown as a tooltip shortly. To see all system messages of the current session open the <a href="window_system_log.html">System Log</a> window from the <a href="#viewmenu">View menu</a> or simply double-click on this part of the status bar.</dd>

    <dt>Away indicator</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_MAIN_AWAY">Shows &quot;AWAY&quot; when DC++ is in <a href="settings_appearance.html#awaymsg">away mode</a>.<br/>
	Double-click to switch away mode on and off.</dd>

    <dd cshelp="IDH_MAIN_HUBS">Shows the number of hubs you are currently connected to in the following format: x/y/z, where:

		y = number of connected hubs where you're registered in;<br/>
		z = number of connected hubs where you're an operator;
    	</p>
        just the same way as in the <a href="faq_plusplus_tag.html">DC++ tags</a> of the users listed on a hub.
