<h2>Tabs</h2>
You can control all opened DC++ windows with their tabs. Tabs in DC++ are generally behave like in other Windows applications, except that they have several additional functions. You can select them or switch between them by the mouse or usinng Ctrl+Tab key combination. If more tabs opened they will automatically occupy more than one row. Every tab has its own right click menu where you may find additional functions for the window the tab belongs to. You can rearrange the tabs by drag & drop, or close them by middle click or by choosing Close from their right click menu.<br/>
There are several options that you can use to customize the look and behavior of the tabs. You can find them in the <a href="settings_tabs.html">Tabs settings</a> and <a href="settings_windows.html">Windows settings</a> respectively.
