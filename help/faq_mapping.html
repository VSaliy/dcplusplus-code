<h1>What is NAT-PMP / UPnP?</h1>
<p>NAT-PMP and Universal Plug And Play (UPnP) are technologies that allow, among other things,
Internet applications to configure home routers and gateways, bypassing manual port forwarding
configuration. To take advantage of these methods, you must have NAT-PMP or UPnP capable hardware.</p>
<p>When DC++ detects a working NAT-PMP or UPnP implementation, it leverages it to automatically
create the required port mappings and gather your external IP address; this allows DC++ to fully
operate in Active mode.</p>
<p>If you are unable to have your router support NAT-PMP or UPnP, follow the
<a href="faq_activemode.html">Manual port forwarding</a> guide for information on how to manually
set up the ports that DC++ needs for its active mode.</p>
