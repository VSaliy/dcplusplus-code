<h1>Security &amp; certificates</h1>

<h2>Security certificates</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_CERTIFICATES">The following are the paths of trusted certificate files. Default values are empty 
which means the files will be created and loaded from a subfolder named 'Certificates' located at the same folder as your <a href="faq_settings_files.html">DC++ settings files</a>.</p>

<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Private key file</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE">This file is your personal and private certificate file. <b>Do not share this with other users or hubs.</b> If you do, you risk allowing others to use your certificate and in essence pose as you.</dd>
  <dt>Own certificate file</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_CERTIFICATE_FILE">This file is the certificate file you should give to other users and hubs that you want to consider "trusted". </dd>
  <dt>Trusted certificates path</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATES_PATH">Where trusted certificates from users or hubs will be stored. (default: the "Certificates\" subdirectory of where you've installed the application.) </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Secure connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Require TLS ADC client-client connections</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_REQUIRE_TLS">Enable this to force encrypted only transfers between clients in ADC hubs. Note that this may result connection problems to clients that doesn't properly support TLS versions and / or safe encryption methods that DC++ require.</dd>
  <dt>Allow TLS connections to hubs without trusted certificate</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_HUBS">With this option disabled, all hubs you connect to must have a certificate in your Trusted certificate folder.</dd>
  <dt>Allow TLS connections to clients without trusted certificate</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_CLIENTS">With this option disabled, all client you connect to must have a certificate in your Trusted certificate folder.</dd>
  <dt>Support direct encrypted private message channels</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_ENABLE_CCPM">
  Enable support for peer-to-peer private messages that hubs can't spy upon.
  <a href="window_pm.html#ccpm">Check the PM window help for more information.</a>
  </dd>
  <dt>Always attempt to establish direct encrypted private message channels</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_ALWAYS_CCPM">
  Try to initiate a peer-to-peer connection whenever the user in private message windows shows up.

To see effects, please restart DC++.

Note: TLS support is an experimental feature and doesn't imply that DC++ is secure in any way.
