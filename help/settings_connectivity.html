<h1>Connectivity</h1>
<h2 id="autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</h2>
<p>
Connectivity settings must be correctly configured for searches and downloads to work. In most
cases, DC++ is able to detect the best connectivity settings by itself. When it can't (for example,
when multiple network cards are available or when the network topology is too complicated), the
various connectivity settings can still be manually adjusted from the "Manual configuration" page.
</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Let DC++ determine the best connectivity settings</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_AUTODETECT">
  Select this to let DC++ determine the best connectivity settings on your behalf. This should work with
  the majority of network structures DC++ is generally used in. The success rate depends on
  operating system configuration and on the network topology.<br/>
  Note that when this option is active, <u>manual connectivity settings will be ignored</u>.
  <p>It is recommended to disable this option and to manually set up connectivity settings when the network topology is not easy for DC++ to figure out, such as:
  	<ul>
  		<li>When there is more than one physical network device (eg. network cards, 3G USB modems) plugged in the computer (the bind address will have to be fiddled with).</li>
  		<li>In the presence of network tunneling, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn" target="_blank" class="external">VPN</a> service or any other software that creates virtual network devices.</li>
  		<li>When DC++ is only supposed to connect to local network hubs (eg. in a campus).</li>
  	</ul>

  <dt>Detect now</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_DETECT_NOW">With this button, you can force DC++ to (re)detect the best connectivity settings. Details and the result of the operation will be shown in the "Detection log" box below.</dd>
  <dt>Detection log</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_DETECTION_LOG">This box contains the log and result of the last connectivity auto-detection started by clicking the "Detect now" button. It contains the detection steps, possible error messages and shows
  why a certain connection mode was chosen. This information is helpful in case of errors or when the result
  is other than expected. Detection messages appear in the System log as well; descriptions of the various
  messages are available in the <a href="window_system_log.html">list of System log messages</a>.</dd>
