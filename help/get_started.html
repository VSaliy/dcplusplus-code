<h1>Get started</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome! DC++ is a free, open-source client for Direct Connect file
sharing networks. It is fully compatible with and supports connection to
hubs using the earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_network" target="_blank" class="external">NeoModus Direct Connect (NMDC)</a> protocol, but its primary purpose is to be a client for a new generation of
file sharing using a protocol called <a href="http://adc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" class="external">Advanced Direct Connect (ADC)</a>.</p> 

<p>The newest version of DC++ should work well on any officially supported Windows
client operating system, including XP SP3, Vista SP1 and Windows 7. Some older 
versions will run on Windows 2000 or Win9x/ME but using DC++ on these old, discontinued
and vulnerable operating systems is neither recommended nor supported. 
As long as it downloaded from the <a href="http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" class="external">official site</a>,
DC++ contains no viruses or adware of any kind. DC++ is free; if you paid for
it, ask for a refund!</p> 

<h2>Structure of the Direct Connect network</h2>

<p>The Direct Connect (DC) network is a decentralized network, made up of
individual servers <b>(hubs)</b> that users join to share files. Users can
<b>search</b> for files and <b>download</b> them from other users connected to
the same hub. A hub only helps to find files and connect users; it <i>does not
store any files</i>. File transfers are done directly between clients, in
peer-to-peer fashion. </p>

<p>Every hub also acts as an instant messaging server. Users can chat with other
users of the same hub using the main chat (visible to every user on the hub)
or, alternatively, start a private conversation with a particular user.  Some
hubs also have special chat rooms for groups of people, such as having a chat
only for operators. </p>

<p>Each hub is individually administered, and some hubs are built around sharing a
particular type of content.
<i>Rules</i> vary from hub to hub, but most have a restriction on the minimum
amount and type of content a user may share (for example, some hubs disallow
sharing of pornography).  Hubs typically have operators (or <i>ops</i>)
appointed by the actual owner of the hub to police these rules and ban
offenders, as well as help new users. </p>

<p>There are two basic kinds of hubs. <b>Public hubs</b> are available to anyone
who adheres to the rules and require no registration for connecting.  Some
allow you to connect, but require registration to search or download &#45; this
is a grey area.  In contrast, <b>private hubs</b> always require user
authentication at login, using a username/password combination. To gain access
to these hubs, one must get registered through other channels, such as a web
forum or a public hub maintained by the same people. </p>

<p>There are <b>Hublists</b> hosted by individual hublist servers to allow users
to find hubs that they might like. These lists contain the <i>name</i>,
<i>address</i> and <i>description</i> of each hub along with other data. Some
big hublists try to contain almost all available hubs while others contain only
a list of hubs meeting certain criteria, such as hubs in a specific country.
</p>

<h2>Connecting to DC hubs using DC++</h2>

<p>DC++ has a few public <b>hublist servers</b> configured by default. They are
the most popular and reliable ones so they are available most of the time. You
can open up the <a href="window_public_hubs.html">Public Hublist</a> window by
using the View/Public Hubs menu item or by clicking on the appropriate icon in the <a href="window_main.html#toolbar">Toolbar</a>. You can <a href="dialog_public_hub_lists.html">add other hublist servers</a> or manage a
list of your own <a href="window_favorite_hubs.html">Favorite hubs</a>.  If you
simply want to connect to a particular hub with a known address you can do it
using File/Quick Connect.</p>

<p>However, before connecting to any hub you should familiarize yourself with the
basic principles of the DC network and have your client set up correctly to
enjoy all the possibilities and benefits of Direct Connect.</p>

<h2>Basic settings and usage</h2>

<a href="http://www.b.ali.btinternet.co.uk/DCPlusPlus/gettingStarted.html#settings" target="_blank" class="external">TheParanoidOne's beginners guide</a> is easy to understand and contains plenty of screenshots.
It explains basic DC++ usage and the minimum settings required to get things up
and running. Make sure you configured all the minimum settings (entered a
unique nick in <a href="settings_general.html">General settings</a>, etc...) or
you won't be able to connect to any hub.

<h2 id="firewall">Checking software firewall settings</h2>

<p>Software firewalls often cause problems as they can completely prevent DC++
from connecting to the Internet. You can skip this section if you can download
hublists and connect to hubs. However, if you can't connect to any hub or
download any hublist <u>while your other programs are able to access the
Internet</u> then it's possible that a software firewall is blocking DC++.
</p>

<p>All officially supported Windows operating systems (XP with Service Pack 3, Vista and Windows 7) have
a built in firewall enabled by default. Moreover, almost all anti-virus suites
(Norton, McAfee, CA, Eset, Kaspersky, F-Secure, AVG, etc.) include a firewall
component with their "typical" install method. Because of this, you can still
have a firewall running even if you've never installed a separate firewall
product or seen a sign of its operation.</p>

<p>If you use Windows XP with third party software firewall installed then make 
sure you have the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283673" target="_blank" class="external">internal Windows firewall disabled</a>. 
On Vista and Windows 7 this should be automatically done by your 3rd party firewall application.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to check if DC++ is blocked is to go the Help/About menu in
DC++ and check if it can download the Latest Version number (bottom box of the
window). A version number should appear in the box soon. If you get error
message instead it means something is preventing DC++ from accessing the
Internet.</p>

<p><a href="faq_activemode.html#firewall">Here are some tips</a> how to try to unblock DC++ in the built-in Windows firewall.</p>

<p>The method for unblocking programs in 3rd party firewalls varies from product to product.
Check your firewall's help or manual for instructions. The best general practice is to
exit DC++ and remove ALL the rules for DC++ in the firewall configuration. In
most cases the time of next start of DC++ you'll be shown a popup window where
you can re-enable DC++. You can find configuration instructions for some
popular firewall software <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/dc/3.1_Software_Firewalls" target="_blank" class="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="connection">Setting up your connection</h2>

<p>To make your life easier while using DC++ your connection must be set up correctly.
In other words your incoming connection type must be correctly chosen for searches and
downloads to work. The available connection modes depend on the structure of your network
and the way you access the Internet. From a protocol perspective, there are two connection
methods available: <b>active mode</b> and <b>passive mode</b>. While passive
mode is almost guaranteed to work, it does not work as well as a properly
configured active mode connection. For a more in-depth explanation, read
<a href="faq_whyactive.html">Why do I need active mode?</a></p>

<p>In most cases DC++ should be able to detect the appropriate connection method for you.
The <a href="settings_connection.html">automatic connection type detection feature</a>
is enabled by default and it tries to decide the best available connection mode at start.
If you able to search and download from the users of the hubs you're connected to then
you're done.</p>

<p>If searches and/or downloads do not work then make sure that <a href="settings_connection.html">
Enable automatic connection type detection</a> setting is enabled. If it doesn't help
(or it forces you into passive mode and you want to improve your connectivity) then follow
<a href="faq_connection.html">the FAQ that tells you how to set up connection manually in DC++.</a></p>
