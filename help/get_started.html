 protocol, now its primary purpose is to be a client for a new generation of file sharing using a protocol called

<br/><br/>
The newest version of DC++ should work well on any edition of modern Windows NT based operating systems such as Windows 2000, XP and Vista. Some older versions will run on Win9x/ME but using DC++ on these ancient operating systems is neither recommended nor supported. As long as it downloaded from the 
<a href="http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" class="external">trusted home page</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>, DC++ contains no viruses or adware of any kind. DC++ is for free so if you paid for it, ask for refund!!
<br/>

<h2>Structure of the Direct Connect network</h2>
The Direct Connect (DC) network is a decentralized network, made up of individual servers <b>(hubs)</b> that users join to share files with other members on that hub. Hubs feature a <i>list of users</i> connected to them. Users can <b>search</b> for files and <b>download</b> them from other connected users. A hub only helps to find files and connect users, it <i>does not store any files</i> so file transfers are done directly between clients, in peer-to-peer fashion.<br/><br/>
Every hub acts as an instant messaging server as well so users can chat with other users of the same hub by either using the main chat (visible for every user of a hub) or starting private conversations with a particular user.
Each hub is individually run by a fellow user of the Direct Connect network, and may have certain themes to the content on the hub. Hub owners set up <i>rules</i> to regulate their hub as they see fit. Many have requirements on the total size of the files that their members share (share size), and restrictions on the content and quality of shares. A hub may choose certain individuals called operators who are responsible to help normal users and and force them to observe the rules of the hub.<br/><br/>
There are two kinds of hubs exist: <b>Public hubs</b> which are available for everyone (who meet the rules of a certain hub) and require no registration for connect (they may need registration to be able to use their additional features though). On the other hand <b>Private hubs</b> always require user authentication at login. Authentication is done by a registered username and password combination. So one needs an invitation from the owner or an existing member of a private hub before beeing able to connect. 
<br/><br/>
There are <b>Hublists</b> hosted by individual hublist servers to provide lists of available hubs. These lists contain the <i>name</i>, <i>address</i> and <i>description</i> of each hub along with other data. Some big hublists try to contain almost all available hubs while others contain only a list of hubs for a special interest.
<br/>

<h2>Connecting to DC hubs using DC++</h2>
DC++ has a few public <b>hublist servers</b> configured by default. They are the most popular and reliable ones so they are available most of the time. You can open up the <a href="window_public_hubs.html">Public Hublist</a> window by using View/Public Hubs menuitem or clicking the appropriate icon in the <a href="window_main.html#toolbar">Toolbar</a>. You are able to <a href="dialog_public_hub_lists.html">add other hublist servers</a> or manage a list of your own <a href="window_favorite_hubs.html">Favorite hubs</a>. 
If you simply want to connect to a particular hub with a known address you can do it by using the File/Quick Connect menu command. 
<br/>
However before connecting to any hub you are recommended to be familiar with the basic principles of the DC network and have your client set up correctly to enjoy all the possibilities and benefits of Direct Connect.
<br/>
<h2>Basic settings and usage</h2>
<a href="http://www.b.ali.btinternet.co.uk/DCPlusPlus/gettingStarted.html#settings" target="_blank" class="external">TheParanoidOne's beginners guide</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/> explains basic DC++ usage and the minimum settings needed. A great, easy to understand FAQ with screenshots, so it shouldn't be missed. Make sure you did all the minimum settings (entered a unique nick in <a href="settings_general.html">General settings</a>, etc...) or you won't even be able to connect to any hub.

<h2>Checking software firewall settings</h2>
Software firewalls are often cause problems as they can completely prevent DC++ from being connected to Internet. You can skip this section if you can download hublists and connect to hubs. However if you can't connect to any hub or even can't download any hublist <u>while your other programs able to access the Internet</u> then its possible that a software firewall blocks DC++.
<br/><br/>
Newer Windows operating systems (XP with Service Pack 1,2 or 3 and Vista) have a built in firewall enabled by default. Moreover, almost all anti-virus suites include firewall component (like Norton, McAfee, CA, Eset, Kaspersky, F-Secure, etc..) with their "typical" install method. So you can still have a firewall running even if you've never installed a separate firewall product or never seen a slight sign of its operation.
<br/><br/>
The easiest way to check if DC++ is blocked to go the Help/About menu in DC++ and check if it can download the Latest Version number (bottom box of the window). A version number should appear in the box soon. If you get error message instead it means something keeps DC++ from accessing the Internet.
<br/><br/>
The way of unblocking programs in firewalls varies product by product. Check your firewall's help or manual how to do this. The best practice is to exit DC++ and remove ALL the rules for DC++ in the firewall configuration. In most cases the time of next start of DC++ you'll be shown a popup window where you can re-enable DC++. You can find configuration method for some popular firewall software

<h2>Setting up your connection</h2>
To make your life easier while using DC++ you should find out what connection mode suits you best. There are two connection methods availabe in DC++, <b>active mode</b> and <b>passive mode</b>. While choosing passive mode is easier <u>it is not efficient</u> (neither for the user nor for the network). <u>Active mode is always preferred</u>, here's the explanation why is it better for you : <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/6517" target="_blank" class="external">Why do I need active mode?</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>
<br/><br/>
It is very important to decide what <i>active connection mode</i> available for you. It depends on your network stucture so it is required to know how do you access the Internet. Is it a direct connection through a modem or you have a local network and you access the Internet through a router or other gateway? If you unsure <a href="http://www.b.ali.btinternet.co.uk/DCPlusPlus/advancedUsage.html#activepassive" target="_blank" class="external">here is a FAQ for help to decide</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>.
<br/><br/>
If you're still unsure what network devices you use to connect to the Internet then use <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" class="external">Google</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>! You got a very helpful information on every single network device : the <u>Model Number</u>, look at your device(s), find the Model Number and a search for it will tell you what your device actually is. Don't skip this step since many ISPs call their device as a simple modem while it is actually a router. 
<br/><br/>
So to choose a proper active connection mode the most important thing is to know : are you <i>behind a router or a gateway</i> or do you <i>access the Internet directly</i>. There is another way to decide : check your <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i> IP addresses. If these IP adresses <b>do NOT match then you access the Internet through a local gateway or a router</b>.
<br/><br/><ul>
<li style="margin-left: 10px;">To see your <i>internal IP address</i> go to the Windows Start menu, click Run... and type : cmd /k ipconfig</li>

<li style="margin-left: 10px;">To see your <i>external IP address</i> go to one of the following websites : 
<a href="http://www.whatismyip.com" target="_blank" class="external">www.whatismyip.com</a><img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>
, <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/ip" target="_blank" class="external">www.dslreports.com/ip</a><img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>
, <a href="http://www.ip2location.com" target="_blank" class="external">www.ip2location.com</a><img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/></li>
</ul>
<br/>
If you are still unsure you may want to consult your ISP support hotline, a system administrator (if you are in an office), etc... 
<br/><br/>
When you look at the <a href="settings_connection.html">Connection Settings</a> you will find 3 options for active mode and the last option for beeing passive as a last resort. For beeing active 
<br/><br/><ul>
<li style="margin-left: 10px;">You can use <i>Direct Connection</i> option <b>ONLY if you don't have a router/gateway</b>.
<li style="margin-left: 10px;">If you <b>have a router/gateway you can use ONLY the 2nd or the 3rd option</b> : <i>Firewall with manual port forwarding</i> or <i>Firewall with UPnP</i></li>
</ul>
For setting up any of the three active mode options follow the <a href="faq_activemode.html">active mode setup FAQ</a>.
<br/><br/>
If none of the above helped or you are not able to use active mode in your network (eg. you have no access to the configuration page of the router/gateway or you have firewall service provided by your ISP,...) then must choose <i>Firewall (passive, last resort)</i> option in <a href="settings_connection.html">Connection Settings</a>. Of course choosing this option means that you should live with all the disadvantages that passive mode has...
