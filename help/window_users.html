<p>This window shows the list of all users of the hubs you connected in the current DC++ session as well as all the detailed information associated with every listed user. It's possible to quickly find any online user from any connected hub and easily keep track of your favorite users, too. With its powerful filtering capabilities this window provides the functionality of the former Favorite Users and Waiting Users window.</p>

<h2>User list columns</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Favorite</dt>
  <dd>The blue star icon shows that this particular user is a favorite. Click the icon to add or remove the user from the favorites.</dd>
  <dt>Auto grant slot</dt>
  <dd>The icon indicates that DC++ should auto grant a favorite user a slot or not. If the indicator is green, DC++ will automatically grant the user a slot; you can click the icon to toggle. The function works only for users already set to favorite.</dd>

  <dd>The nick of the user.</dd>
  <dt>Hub (last seen in, if offline)</dt>
  <dd>Which hub you saw this user the last time.</dd>

<h2>Details pane (right)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_USERS_DETAILS">
	This pane shows you all the available details sent by the DC client of the selected user. The number of records shown can heavily depend on what kind of user selected, what protocol it uses, etc... For example you can get the most information from an ADC client user while the amount of available information from a hub bot is usually very small.
</p>	

<h2>Filters (bottom)</h2>
<p>The user list can be filtered by text, online status and file transfer activity. The following options are available:</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Text filter</dt>
  <dd>
	<p cshelp="IDH_USERS_FILTER">
	<!--#include virtual="window_list_filter.inc" -->
	<div>
		Eg writing "foo" in the filter input box, selecting "Nick" and "Partial match" will only display users that have
		"foo" in their nick.
