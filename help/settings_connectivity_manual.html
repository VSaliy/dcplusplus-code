	<h1>Connectivity<br/>
		Manual configuration
	</h1>
<p>
Use these settings to manually configure DC++ for incoming connections. If unsure about these settings, 
you may want to follow the <a href="faq_connection.html">Manual connection setup guide</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="connection">Manual incoming connection settings</h2>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Before setting up the following settings, make sure you are familiar
	with the meaning of each connection mode and with the <a href="faq_whyactive.html">differences
	between active and passive mode and their effect on your ability to search and download from
	users</a> of the DC network.</p>

<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>Active mode (I have no router / I have configured my router)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_ACTIVE">
	Select this mode if you are directly connected to the Internet (no router) or if you are
	willing to manually configure port forwarding rules in your router. Use this mode only if the
	automatic configuration (via NAT-PMP / UPnP) is not an option for you. For more information,
	refer to the <a href="faq_portforward.html">Manual port forwarding guide</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Active mode (let DC++ configure my router with NAT-PMP / UPnP)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_UPNP">
	Select this mode if you are behind a router that supports standard port forwarding methods such
	as NAT-PMP or UPnP. Most routers do support them but they often have to be explicitly enabled
	from the router's configuration page. Thanks to automatic port mapping methods, DC++ is able to
	open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP address as well. For more information, see
	<a href="faq_mapping.html">What is NAT-PMP / UPnP?</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_PASSIVE">
	Select this mode if you can't get active mode to work. In this mode, DC++ will not try to
	listen for inbound connections; it will only initiate outbound ones. This mode carries some
	serious limitations:
	<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches.</li>
		<li>you may not be able to download / receive search results from passive users.</li>
		<li>you may not be able to fully enjoy certain hubs (because of their regulations).</li>
	</ul>
	Note that DC++ tries NAT Traversal on ADC hubs to allow passive users to connect with each other.
	</dd>

	<dt id="extip">External / WAN IP</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_EXTERNAL_IP">
	This field specifies your external IP address. <i>Note: most hubs are able to determine your
		external IP and forward it to your DC++, making a manual configuration of this field
		unnecessary.</i> If your computer is directly connected to the internet, your internal and
	external IP will be the same and can easily be automatically detected. Fill this box
	<b>only</b> if you need to override said auto-detection. Ordinarily, only users behind a router
	(NAT device) need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to resolve it
	into an IP address before use. For additional information like how to determine your external IP
	address, follow the <a href="faq_connection.html">Manual connection setup guide</a>.</dd>

	<dt id="noipoverride">Don't allow hubs/NAT-PMP/UPnP to override</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_OVERRIDE">
	Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP", and not let either NAT-PMP,
	UPnP nor connected hubs change it. If unsure, leave this setting disabled.
	</dd>

	<dt>Ports</dt>
	<dd><p>These settings specify the communication ports DC++ listens on for incoming connections.
	Generally you don't need to add specific ports unless you configured your port forwarding settings
	manually. If port settings are left blank, DC++ will let the operating system generate a random
	port number. Port values are ignored when
	<a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> is enabled.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Transfer port (TCP)</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_PORT_TCP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for
		incoming connections from other peers. If this port is incorrectly forwarded, you won't be
		able to download.</dd>
		<dt>Encrypted transfer port (TCP)</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_PORT_TLS">This is the port that DC++ listens on for
		incoming <a href="settings_certs.html">TLS (encrypted)</a> connections from other peers. If
		this port is incorrectly forwarded, you won't be able to search nor to download on
		encrypted ADC hubs. Note that <b>this port value should be different than the ones used for
			transfers (TCP) and searches (UDP).</b></dd>
		<dt>Search port (UDP)</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_PORT_UDP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for
		incoming search results. If this port is incorrectly forwarded, you won't be able to
		receive search results.</dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>

	<dt id="prefmap">Preferred port mapping interface</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_MAPPER">
	DC++ has several interfaces available it can use to try to automatically map the ports it
	requires on the router:
	<ul>
		<li>NAT-PMP: A lightweight protocol that is not widely used by generic routers; but
		open-source firmwares generally implement it.</li>
		<li>MiniUPnP: An open-source UPnP library.</li>
	</ul>
	The interface selected here will be tried first; other available interfaces will then be tried
	if the preferred port mapping interface were to fail.
	</dd>

	<dt id="bindaddress">Bind address</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_BIND_ADDRESS">
	This setting allows binding DC++ network connections to a specific network adapter by its IP
	address. Useful when you have more than one physical or virtual network adapter installed and
	you want to assign a specfic device for all the network traffic generated by DC++.<br/>
	If this setting is empty (it is by default) it means that DC++ is relying on the operating
	system to find the best adapter. In case of the adapter offered by the operating system does
	not suit you, you can override it here by specifying the local IP address of the required
	adapter. To get the list of available network adapters with their IP adresses open up a Command
	Prompt window and use the 'ipconfig' command.<br/>
	If binding with the given IP address fails, it will do so silently and the default value
	(INADDR_ANY) will be used instead. This setting is ignored when
	<a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> is enabled.
