<h1>Connection settings</h1>
<h2 id="autoconn">Automatic connection type detection</h2>
<p>
  Your incoming connection type must be correctly chosen for searches and downloads to work. In most cases DC++ 
  is able to detect the best incoming connection type for you so its recommended to leave the automatic detection
  option enabled and let DC++ auto-configure your settings. This way the required connection settings will be 
  determined automatically and all <u>manual connection settings will be ignored</u>. If automatic detection fails,
  the determined connection type doesn't work or the result is fallback to passive mode then you can disable
  the automatic detection and set up your connection manually in a hope to achieve better connectivity.
</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Enable automatic incoming connection type detection</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_AUTODETECT">Select this if you want to make DC++ determine the best connection type
  for you. This should work with the majority of network structures DC++ used in. Possibility of successful
  active mode detection may depend on operating system configuration and network devices used.
  <b>Disable this option if you use DC++ in a local network only (eg. in a campus, etc..).</b></dd>
  <dt>Detect now</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DETECT_NOW">With this button, you can force DC++ to (re)detect the best connection
   mode available to you. Details and result of the operation will be shown in the Detection log box below.</dd>
  <dt>Detection log</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DETECTION_LOG">This box contains the log and result of the last connection type
  detection started by clicking the Detect now button. It'll contain the detection steps, possible error messages and shows
  you why a certain connection mode was chosen. These information are helpful in case of errors or when the result
  is other than expected. Detection messages will appear in the System log as well; description of all the possible
  messages are available in the <a href="window_system_log.html">list of System log messages</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="connection">Incoming connection settings</h2>
<p>
Use these settings to manually configure DC++ for incoming connections. If unsure, you may want to follow the <a href="get_started.html#connection">connection setup part</a> of the <a href="get_started.html">Get Started guide</a>.
You should disable Automatic connection type detection to make these settings manually configurable.
</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Before set up the following settings make sure you familiar with the meaning of all connection modes, 
  <a href="faq_whyactive.html">differences between active and passive mode and their effect on 
  your ability to search and download from users</a> of the DC network.</p> 
  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Active connection modes</u></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Active are the preferred connection modes in the DC network. In case of any problems with 
  setting up active connection modes please follow the detailed <a href="faq_activemode.html">
  Active mode FAQ</a> for help.</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>My computer is directly connected to Internet (no router)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT">Select this mode if your computer is connected directly to the
internet or you plan to connect to hubs in your local network only. <b>Do <u>not</u> select this mode if 
you have a router or any external firewall.</b> 
If your computer is not behind a router all you have to do is to choose this option and usually 
you don't need to alter anything more in the connection settings. However, if you have a software firewall
installed or built-in Windows firewall enabled, you may need further configuration in the firewall 
to allow Internet access for DC++.</dd>
  <dt>Use UPnP to let DC++ configure my router</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_UPNP">Select this mode if you are
behind a firewall/router that supports
the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. Most routers do support UPnP but you may need to
enable it in the router's configuration page. This way DC++ will
automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP
address as well. This mode is available only in Windows XP and newer operating systems.
In case of problems there is a complete <a href="faq_upnp.html">guide
to configuring and troubleshooting UPnP</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_NAT">Select this mode if you are behind a firewall (router), and will
set up the TCP, UDP and TLS port forwarding on your own. You <u>will</u> need to specify the
external IP address of your router using the setting below if you want
downloads to work properly. Use this mode only if the previous ones are not options for you. You can read the
<a href="faq_activemode.html">Active mode guide</a> to get help how to set up manual port forwarding.</dd>
</dl>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Passive connection mode</u></h3> 
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_PASSIVE">Select this mode if none of the previous Active mode options apply. In this
mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound
ones. This mode carries some serious limitations:
  <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches;</li>
    <li>you may won't be able to download from all (passive) users;</li>
    <li>you may won't be able to search and/or download on certain hubs (because of their regulations);</li>
  </ul>

<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Connection mode options</u></h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dt>Ports</dt>
<dd><p>Here you can specify what communication ports should DC++ use to accept incoming connections. 
Generally you don't need to add specific ports unless you configured your port forwarding settings manually.
If the ports not set DC++ will try to assgin them automatically in various ways depending on what connection
mode used. So if you use any conncetion mode option other than 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)'
then its best to leave the port fields empty. If port settings are left blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.
Port values will be ignored if <a href="autoconn">Automatic incoming connection type detection</a> is enabled.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>TCP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TCP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client
connections. If this port incorrectly forwarded you won't be able to download. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other

  <dt>UDP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_UDP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search

  <dt>TLS</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TLS">This is the port that DC++ listens on for <a href="settings_certs.html">TLS encrypted</a> connections.
  If this port incorrectly forwarded you won't be able to search and/or download on specific ADC hubs where secure connections required. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i> However, if specified, <b>this port value should be different than the ones that used for TCP or UDP.</b></dd>

<dt>External / WAN IP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL_IP">This field specifies your external IP address. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i> If your computer is directly connected to the internet, your internal and external IP is the same and can easily be automatically detected. Fill in this box <b>only</b> if you need to override the auto-detection. Ordinarily, only users behind a firewall/router (NAT device) may need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use. To know how to determine your external IP address follow the 
<a href="get_started.html#connection">connection setup part</a> of the <a href="get_started.html">Get Started guide</a> or the detailed <a href="faq_activemode.html">Active mode FAQ</a>. IP address set here will be deleted if you enable <a href="autoconn">Automatic incoming connection type detection</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="noipoverride">Don't allow hub/UPnP to override</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_OVERRIDE">Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP",
and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it. If unsure leave this setting disabled. This option will be cleared if you enable <a href="autoconn"> Automatic incoming connection type detection</a>.</dd>
