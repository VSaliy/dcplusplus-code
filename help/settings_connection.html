<h1 id="connection">Connection settings</h1>
<p>
Use these settings to properly configure DC++
for incoming and outgoing connections. Your incoming connection
type must be correctly chosen for downloads to work. If unsure
about these settings, you may want to follow the 
<a href="get_started.html#connection">connection setup part</a>
of the <a href="get_started.html">Get Started guide</a>.
</p>
<h2>Incoming connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>My computer is directly connected to Internet (no router)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT">Select this mode if your computer is hooked directly to the
internet. Do <u>not</u>
select this mode if you have a router (external firewall).</dd>
  <dt>Try to use UPnP to let Windows automatically configure my router</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_UPNP">Select this mode if you are
behind a firewall that supports
the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. DC++ will
automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP
address. This mode is not available on operating systems
before
Windows XP, as it was the first version to have UPnP
support. There is a <a href="faq_upnp.html">guide
to configuring UPnP</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Manual port forwarding (i have configured my router by myself)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_NAT">Select this mode if you are behind a firewall (router), and will
set up the TCP and UDP port forwarding on your own. You <u>will</u> need to specify the
external IP address of your router using the setting below if you want
downloads to work properly. Use <a href="faq_activemode.html">this
guide</a> to set up active mode.</dd>
  <dt>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_PASSIVE">Select this mode if none of the previous options apply. In this
mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound
ones. This mode carries some limitations:
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches;</li>
  <li>you will not be able to download from other passive users.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Options</h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 80px;">
<dt>Ports</dt>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>TCP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TCP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client
connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port
between 1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>UDP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_UDP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search
results. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>TLS</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TLS">This is the port that DC++ listens on for <a href="settings_certs.html">TLS</a> connections.
 If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
 1025 and 32000. If specified, <b>it should be a different port value than TCP or UDP.</b></dd>
</dl></dd>
  <dt>External / WAN IP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL_IP">If you're directly connected to the internet, DC++ will tell remote users to connect to your local IP.
Fill in this box <b>only</b> if you need to override the auto-detection.
Ordinarily, only users behind a home router (NAT device) will need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name
here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use.</dd>
  <dt>Don't allow hub/UPnP to override</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_OVERRIDE">Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP",
and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Outgoing connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct connection</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT_OUT">Select this mode if you can make unrestricted outbound
connections. This includes connecting to any IP address on any port.</dd>
  <dt>SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS5">Select this mode if you want to make outbound connections through
a SOCKS proxy. The caveats for Firewall (passive) mode also apply here.
SOCKS5 proxies are <u>not</u>
the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5 support does <u>not</u> include GSSAPI.</dd>

  <dt>Port</dt>

server, to resolve host names into IP addresses.</dd>
