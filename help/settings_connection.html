<h1 id="connection">Connection settings</h1>
<p>
Use these settings to properly configure DC++
for incoming and outgoing connections. Your incoming connection
type must be correctly chosen for downloads to work. If unsure
about these settings, you may want to follow the 
<a href="get_started.html#connection">connection setup part</a>
of the <a href="get_started.html">Get Started guide</a>.
</p>
<h2>Incoming connection settings</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Before set up the following settings make sure you familiar with the meaning of all connection modes, 
  <a href="faq_whyactive.html">differences between active and passive mode and their effect on 
  your ability to search and download from users</a> of the DC network.</p> 
  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Active connection modes</u></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Active are the preferred connection modes in the DC network. In case of any problems with 
  setting up active connection modes please follow the detailed <a href="faq_activemode.html">
  Active mode FAQ</a> for help.</p>	  
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>My computer is directly connected to Internet (no router)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT">Select this mode if your computer is connected directly to the
internet. <b>Do <u>not</u> select this mode if you have a router or any external firewall.</b> 
If your computer is not behind a router all you have to do is to choose this option and usually 
you don't need to alter anything more in the connection settings. However, if you have a software firewall
installed or built-in Windows firewall enabled, you may need further configuration in the firewall 
to allow Internet access for DC++.</dd>
  <dt>Use UPnP to let DC++ configure my router</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_UPNP">Select this mode if you are
behind a firewall/router that supports
the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. Most routers do support UPnP but you may need to
enable it in the router's configuration page. This way DC++ will
automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP
address as well. This mode is available only in Windows XP and newer operating systems.
In case of problems there is a complete <a href="faq_upnp.html">guide
to configuring and troubleshooting UPnP</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_NAT">Select this mode if you are behind a firewall (router), and will
set up the TCP, UDP and TLS port forwarding on your own. You <u>will</u> need to specify the
external IP address of your router using the setting below if you want
downloads to work properly. Use this mode only if the previous ones are not options for you. You can read the
<a href="faq_activemode.html">Active mode guide</a> to get help how to set up manual port forwarding.</dd>
</dl>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Passive connection mode</u></h3> 
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_PASSIVE">Select this mode if none of the previous Active mode options apply. In this
mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound
ones. This mode carries some serious limitations:
  <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches;</li>
    <li>you will not be able to download from other passive users.</li>
    <li>you may won't be able to search and/or download on certain hubs.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><u>Connection mode options</u></h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dt>Ports</dt>
<dd><p>Here you can specify what communication ports should DC++ use to accept incoming connections. 
Generally you don't need to add specific ports unless you configured your port forwarding settings manually.
If the ports not set DC++ will try to assgin them automatically in various ways depending on what connection
mode used. So if you use any conncetion mode option other than 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)'
then its best to leave the port fields empty. If port settings are left blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>TCP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TCP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client
connections. If this port incorrectly forwarded you won't be able to download. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other 
than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i></dd>
  <dt>UDP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_UDP">This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search
results. If this port incorrectly forwarded you won't be able to receive search results. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i></dd>
  <dt>TLS</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TLS">This is the port that DC++ listens on for <a href="settings_certs.html">TLS encrypted</a> connections.
  If this port incorrectly forwarded you won't be able to search and/or download on specific ADC hubs where secure connections required. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i> However, if specified, <b>this port value should be different than the ones that used for TCP or UDP.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>External / WAN IP</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL_IP">This field specifies your external IP address. <i>If you unsure and use any conncetion mode option <u>other than</u></i> 'Manual port forwarding (I have configured my router by myself)' <i>then leave this field blank.</i> If your computer is directly connected to the internet, your internal and external IP is the same and can easily be automatically detected. Fill in this box <b>only</b> if you need to override the auto-detection. Ordinarily, only users behind a firewall/router (NAT device) may need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use. To know how to determine your external IP address follow the 
<a href="get_started.html#connection">connection setup part</a> of the <a href="get_started.html">Get Started guide</a> or the detailed <a href="faq_activemode.html">Active mode FAQ</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Don't allow hub/UPnP to override</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_OVERRIDE">Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP",
and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it. If unsure leave this setting disabled.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Outgoing connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct connection</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT_OUT">Select this mode if you can make unrestricted outbound
connections. This includes connecting to any IP address on any port. Choose this option if unsure.</dd>
  <dt>SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS5">Select this mode if you want to make outbound connections through
a SOCKS proxy. The caveats for Firewall (passive) mode also apply here.
SOCKS5 proxies are <u>not</u>
the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5 support does <u>not</u> include GSSAPI.</dd>
