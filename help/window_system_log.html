<h1>System log</h1>
<p>This window displays important and current information about DC++ and your interactions with the program. If DC++ behaves unexpectedly, you can look in this window for a possible explanation.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of messages can appear in the System log : <u>events</u> and <u>errors</u>. While the first kind of messages are usual, you may want to pay more attention to the latter ones. Error messages shown in the log may come from some failed automatic operation or as a result of your latest interaction with the program interface. The very last message entry in the log is shown in the statusbar of the main DC++ window. You can check the tooltip of the status bar for the last few log entries.</p>
<p>Note that <i>not all</i> error messages appear in the System log. Some windows (like Download Queue or Search) have their own functional status bar and messages related to those windows may appear only on their own place.</p> 

<h2>Context menu commands</h2>

<p>Messages may contain path of file(s) associated with them. The path appears between &lt;brackets&gt; and a right click in it will bring up a context menu with possibility to open/check the particular file in Windows Explorer.</p>
<!--#include virtual="commands_file_management.inc" --> 

<h2>Event messages</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>File list refresh initiated</dt>
	<dd>This message means that shared folders has been started to check for new or changed files. The process can be initiated automatically (once at startup and then periodically according to the <a href="settings_expert.html#autorefresh">Auto file list refresh</a> setting) or manually by the Refresh file list menu command in the <a href="window_main.html#filemenu">File menu</a>. The new or changed content will be (re)hashed and a log entry will
	be added for each hashed file (see below).</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh finished</dt>
	<dd>This indicates an end of the current hashing procedure. As long as your shared files remain unchaged the filelist reflects the current state of your share.</dd>
	<dt>Finished hashing: [path] ([size] at [speed])</dt>
	<dd>Shown for each successfully hashed file including the full path, filesize and hashing speed. Speed value may won't be added for small files.</dd>
	<dt>[Nick]: matched [x] files</dt>
	<dd>This message is shown when someone's filelist has just matched to your queue. [x] shows the number of found matches.</dd>
	<dt>Duplicate file will not be shared: [path1] (Size: [size]) Dupe matched against: [path2]</dt>
	<dd>This means that since you have <a href="settings_advanced.html#listdupes">Keep duplicate files in your file list</a>
	setting disabled, a file ([path1]) beeing indexed and already shared (as [path2]) won't be added to your share again.</dd>
	<dt>Hash database rebuilt</dt>
	<dd>Informs you about the finish of a full hash database rebuilding process which can be initiated by the <a href="chat_commands.html">/rebuild</a> chat command</dd>
	<dt>Disconnected user leaving the hub: [nick]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</a> setting enabled and this message informs you about its effect.</dd>
	<dt>MAGNET Link detected: [link]</dt>
	<dd>The client received a <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">magnet link</a> handle request.</dd>
	<dt>Generated new TLS certificate</dt>
	<dd>As <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates</a> enabled but no existing TLS certificate files found (or they are invalid), new certificate files generated in the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Successfully created port mappings (Transfers: [port1], Searches: [port2], Encrypted transfers: [port3]) on the [router name] device with the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ has managed to automatically create port forwarding rules on the router with <a href="faq_mapping.html">NAT-PMP or UPnP</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Determining connection type...</dt>
	<dd>This message signs that <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic incoming connection type detection</a> is started.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Public IP address detected, selecting active mode with direct connection</dt>
	<dd>It means that <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connection type detection</a> determined that you have a public IP address so it assumed that you are directly connected to the Internet. The appropriate connection type selected.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Local network with possible NAT detected, trying to map the ports using UPnP...</dt>
	<dd><a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connection type detection</a> determined that you have a <a href="non-routable.html">private</a> IP address and it started to discover for a possible UPnP capable gateway (router).</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Automatic setup of active mode has failed. You may want to set up your connection manually for better connectivity</dt>
	<dd><a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic incoming connection type detection</a> did not find any way to configure any kind of active connection so as a last resort it selected passive connection mode with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal" target="_blank" class="external">NAT traversal</a> capability.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Error messages</h2>
<p>Some errors shown in the log contain additional system messages provided by the operating system. These messages usually tell you more about the exact problem; they are marked as [error message] in the description of possible logged errors below. Note that system messages are always shown in the language of your operating system even if you have chosen another one for DC++.</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>Error registering dchub:// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering adc(s):// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering Magnet link handler</dt>
	<dd>These errors mean that DC++ was unable to register the appropriate link handler(s) in Windows, per the <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">Register with Windows to handle magnet: URI links</a> and <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrydchubadc">Register with Windows to handle dchub://, adc:// and adcs:// URL links</a> settings. The most common reason of an unsuccesful registration is that the user account under which DC++ is running does not have appropriate rights for (write) access the required parts of the Windows Registry.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Failed to get external IP</dt>
	<dd>This error message can appear when DC++ tries to map ports for incoming connections via NAT-PMP / UPnP and means that although port mappings were successful, DC++ couldn't get the external IP address from the UPnP device. If this message persists, it may be because of broken NAT-PMP / UPnP support of the device. This is not very important, since DC++ can still gather the external IP from connected hubs <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#noipoverride">if it is allowed to do so</a>.</dd>
	<dt>UPnP: Failed to create port mappings</dt>
	<dd>This error message can appear when DC++ tries to map ports for incoming connections via UPnP. It means that no UPnP device can be found or its not responding. It can happen that you get this message when <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connection type detection</a> is enabled as DC++ trying to discover a possible UPnP device for setting up active mode. This message is a real problem only if you selected the 'Use UPnP to let DC++ configure my router' option manually in <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">Incoming connection settings</a>. In this case refer to the <a href="faq_upnp.html">UPnP FAQ</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dt>UPnP: Failed to remove port mappings</dt>
	<dd>This message can appear mostly at shutdown of DC++ and means that UPnP port mappings created before couldn't be successfully removed. If this message persists the most probable reason is broken UPnP support of the (router) device.</dd>
	<dt>UPnP: Another UPnP port mapping attempt is in progress...</dt>
	<dd>This means that an <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">automatic connection type detection</a> attempt was started too soon (the previous operation has not been finished). Try restarting DC++ if this message persists. If restart DC++ does not help the most probable reason is broken UPnP support of your (router) device.</dd>
	<dt>UPnP: Failed to initalize the [interface name] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ failed to initalize one of its UPnP interface and will try to use the next one in the row.</dd>
	<dt>UPnP: The [interface name] interface has failed to map the [TCP/UDP/TLS] [port number] port</dt>
	<dd>The currently used UPnP interface failed to map the shown port. DC++ will try to use the next UPnP interface in the row.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Unable to open TCP/UDP/TLS port(s). You must set up your connection manually</dt>
	<dd>You can get this message only when <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connection type detection</a> is enabled and DC++ failed to open port(s) before trying to determine the available conncetion types. Possible reasons include the choosen port(s) are already occupied by another application or DC++ is blocked by a <a href="get_started.html#firewall">software firewall</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Not listening for connections - please restart DC++</dt>
	<dd>An unrecoverable low level networking error keeps DC++ from listening for connections. Search and download won't work until you restart DC++.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity error: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Connectivity restored</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for file transfer connections. The problem lasts until the next 'Connectivity restored' message.</dd>
	<dt>Search disabled: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Search enabled again</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for search results. The problem lasts until the next 'Search enabled again' message.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to load certificate file</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem loading the certificate file, its contents are damaged or invalid.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to load private key</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem loading the private key file, its contents are damaged or invalid.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, failed to generate certificate: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>TLS certificate files are missing or could not be opened. DC++ tried to regenrerate them but it wasn't successful, either. Make sure you have write access rights to the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, no certificate file set</dt>
	<dd>TLS can't be used because no certificate files set. You should set or generate them properly in the <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates</a> page.</dd>
	<dt>CRC32 inconsistency (SFV-Check) : [path]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#sfvcheck">automatic SFV checking enabled</a> and a downloaded file is not passed the SFV-check. The file will be downloaded again.</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh failed: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>The background process for refreshing file list is failed to start.</dd>
	<dt>Hashing failed: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error occured during indexing or share rebuilding.</dd>
	<dt>Error hashing [path]: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when hashing the file specified in [path].</dd>
	<dt>Error saving hash data: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when creating or updating hash index file (HashIndex.xml).</dd>
	<dt>Error creating hash data file: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when creating hash data file (HashData.dat).</dd>
	<dt>[path] not shared; calculated CRC32 does not match the one found in SFV file.</dt>
	<dd>Before sharing files DC++ will automatically check them against an .SFV file (if one exists in the same directory) to make sure that no corrupted files will be shared. If you get this error then either your file(s) are corrupted or the control data in the corresponding .SFV file is outdated or damaged.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to move [path1] to [path2] ([error message]); renamed to [path3]</dt>
	<dd>Moving a finished download [path1] from the unfinished downloads folder to its target place [path2] wasn't successful because of [error message] so the file is left in the unfinished downloads folder and renamed to its orginal name ([path3]).</dd>
	<dt>Unable to move [path1] to [path2] ([error message1]) nor to rename to [path3] ([error message2])</dt>
	<dd>Moving a finished download [path1] from the unfinished downloads folder to its target place [path2] wasn't successful because of [error message1] so the file is left in the unfinished downloads folder. DC++ tried to rename it to its orginal name [path3] but the rename operation has failed either, because of [error message2].</dd>
	<dt>Unable to open filelist: [filename]</dt>
	<dd>There were problems opening a downloaded filelist, its corrupted or its size is <a href="settings_expert.html#maxlistsize">bigger than the maximum size allowed to open</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to send file [path]: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem preparing file [path] upon an upload request by a peer.</dd>
	
	<!-- This can be reused when the message will go to the log again...
	<dt>Someone is trying to use your client to spam [ip address], please urge hub owner to fix this</dt>
	<dd>You are connected to an insecure DC hub where malicious people using your DC client to attack a web server. The owner the hub should
	either upgrade the hubsoftware or set it up correctly to avoid this kind of attacks. As long as you are logged into this hub in its current state you help malicious people to block normal operation of victim servers; not to mention the extra strain the flood causes on <i>your</i> connection.</dd>
