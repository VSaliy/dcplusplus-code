<h1>System log</h1>
<p>This window displays important and current information about DC++ and your interactions with the program. If DC++ behaves unexpectedly, you can look in this window for a possible explanation.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of messages can appear in the System log : <u>events</u> and <u>errors</u>. While the first kind of messages are usual, you may want to pay more attention to the latter ones. Error messages shown in the log may come from some failed automatic operation or as a result of your latest interaction with the program interface. The very last message entry in the log is shown in the statusbar of the main DC++ window. You can check the tooltip of the status bar for the last few log entries.</p>
<p>Messages may contain path of file(s) associated with them. The path appears between &lt;brackets&gt; and a right click in it will bring up a context menu with possibility to open/check the particular file in Windows Explorer. (Description of the context menu options are listed in the <a href="general_menu_commands.html">General Menu Commands</a> page.)</p>
<p>Note that <i>not all</i> error messages appear in the System log. Some windows (like Download Queue or Search) have their own functional status bar and messages related to those windows may appear only on their own place.</p> 

<h2>Event messages</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>File list refresh initiated</dt>
	<dd>This message means that shared folders has been started to check for new or changed files. The process can be initiated automatically (once at startup and then periodically according to the <a href="settings_expert.html#autorefresh">Auto file list refresh</a> setting) or manually by the Refresh file list menu command in the <a href="window_main.html#filemenu">File menu</a>. The new or changed content will be (re)hashed and a log entry will
	be added for each hashed file (see below).</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh finished</dt>
	<dd>This indicates an end of the current hashing procedure. As long as your shared files remain unchaged the filelist reflects the current state of your share.</dd>
	<dt>Finished hashing: [path] ([speed])</dt>
	<dd>Shown for each successfully hashed file including the full path and hashing speed. Speed value may won't be added for small files.</dd>
	<dt>[Nick]: matched [x] files</dt>
	<dd>This message is shown when someone's filelist has just matched to your share. [x] shows the number of found matches.</dd>
	<dt>Duplicate file will not be shared: [path1] (Size: [size]) Dupe matched against: [path2]</dt>
	<dd>This means that since you have <a href="settings_advanced.html#listdupes">Keep duplicate files in your file list</a>
		setting disabled, a file ([path1]) beeing indexed and already shared (as [path2]) won't be added to your share again.</dd>
	<dt>Hash database rebuilt</dt>
	<dd>Informs you about the finish of a full hash database rebuilding process which can be initiated by the <a href="chat_commands.html">/rebuild</a> chat command</dd>
	<dt>Disconnected user leaving the hub: [nick]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</a> setting enabled and this message
		informs you about its effect.</dd>
	<dt>MAGNET Link detected: [link]</dt>
	<dd>The client received a <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">magnet link</a> handle request.</dd>
	<dt>Generated new TLS certificate</dt>
	<dd>As <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates</a> enabled but no existing TLS certificate files found (or they are invalid), new
		 certificate files generated in the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
</dl>	

<h2>Error messages</h2>
<p>Some errors shown in the log contain additional system messages provided by the operating system. These messages usually tell you more about the exact problem; they are marked as [error message] in the description of possible logged errors below. Note that system messages are always shown in the language of your operating system even if you set other locale for DC++.</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>Error registering dchub:// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering adc:// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering Magnet link handler</dt>
	<dd>These errors mean that DC++ was unable to register the appropriate link handler(s) to itself. When <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">Register magnet link</a> and <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrydchubadc">Register adc:// and nmdc://</a> settings enabled, DC++ will try to register these handlers at startup. The most common reason of an unsuccesful registration is that the current user does not have appropriate rights for (write) access the required part of the Windows Registry.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to get external IP via UPnP. Please set it yourself</dt>
	<dd>This error can appear at startup and means that while port mappings were successful, DC++ couldn't get external IP address from the UPnP device. If this message persists it may be because of broken UPnP support of the device.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to create port mappings. Please set up your NAT yourself</dt>
	<dd>This error can appear at startup when <a href="settings_connection.html">incoming connection mode</a> is set to 'Firewall with UPnP' and means that there is no UPnP device can be found or it didn't responded. Refer to the <a href="faq_upnp.html">UPnP FAQ</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to remove port mappings</dt>
	<dd>This message can appear only during shutdown of DC++ and means that UPnP port mappings created
		at startup couldn't be successfully removed. If this message persists it may be because of broken UPnP support of the device.</dd>
	<dt>Not listening for connections - please restart DC++</dt>
	<dd>An unrecoverable low level networking error keeps DC++ from listening for connections. Search and download won't work until you restart DC++.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity error: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Connectivity restored</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for file transfer connections. The problem lasts until the next 'Connectivity restored' message.</dd>
	<dt>Search disabled: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Search enabled again</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for search results. The problem lasts until the next 'Search enabled again' message.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to load certificate file</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem loading the certificate file, its contents are damaged or invalid.</dd>
	<dt>Failed to load private key</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem loading the private key file, its contents are damaged or invalid.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, failed to generate certificate: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>TLS certificate files are missing or could not be opened. DC++ tried to regenrerate them but it wasn't successful, either. Make sure you have write access rights to the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, no certificate file set</dt>
	<dd>TLS can't be used because no certificate files set. You should set or generate them properly in the <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates</a> page.</dd>
	<dt>CRC32 inconsistency (SFV-Check) : [path]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#sfvcheck">automatic SFV checking enabled</a> and a downloaded file is not passed the SFV-check. The file will be downloaded again.</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh failed: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>The background process for refreshing file list is failed to start.</dd>
	<dt>Hashing failed: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error occured during indexing or share rebuilding.</dd>
	<dt>Error hashing [path]: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when hashing the file specified in [path].</dd>
	<dt>Error saving hash data: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when creating or updating hash index file (HashIndex.xml).</dd>
	<dt>Error creating hash data file: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when creating hash data file (HashData.dat).</dd>
	<dt>[path] not shared; calculated CRC32 does not match the one found in SFV file.</dt>
	<dd>Before sharing files DC++ will automatically check them against an .SFV file (if one exists in the same directory) to make sure that no corrupted files will be shared. If you get this error then either your file(s) are corrupted or the control data in the corresponding .SFV file is outdated or damaged.</dd>
	<dt>[path1] renamed to [path2]</dt>
	<dd>There was an error moving a large finished download [path1] from the unfinished folder to its target place [path2] so the file is left in its current folder but renamed to its orginal name.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to rename [path1]: [path2]</dt>
	<dd>There was an error moving a large finished download [path1] from the unfinished folder to its target place so the file is left in its current folder. DC++ tried to rename the file to its orginal name ([path2]) but the rename operation has failed as well.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to open filelist: [filename]</dt>
	<dd>There were problems opening a downloaded filelist, its corrupted or its size is <a href="settings_expert.html#maxlistsize">bigger than the maximum size allowed to open</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to send file [path]: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem preparing file [path] upon an upload request by a peer.</dd>
	<dt>Someone is trying to use your client to spam [ip address], please urge hub owner to fix this</dt>
	<dd>You are connected to an insecure DC hub where malicious people using your DC client to attack a web server. The owner the hub should
	either upgrade the hubsoftware or set it up correctly to avoid this kind of attacks. As long as you are logged into this hub in its current state you help malicious people to block normal operation of victim servers; not to mention the extra strain the flood causes on <i>your</i> connection.</dd>
