<h1> Why don't I get any search results? </h1>
<p>Assuming that you can connect to a hub and chat with users, this is
usually caused by a firewall, router, connection sharing. 
Another possibility is that you do not meet a certain criteria on a hub
so you are not able to perform searches as often as you like.
There are several things you can try:</p>
<h2>If you can't get search results on a particular hub while you can on others</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you are in passive connection mode some hubs may won't allow
   you to search as it stresses the hub a lot. Try to set up active
   mode following the
   <a href="faq_connection.html">Connection setup guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Some hubs allow searches for registered users only. 
   Check login messages, banners, hub addresses or ask an operator how
   to register yourself.</li> 	
  <li>Some hubs have predefined search interval rule to avoid hub
  	overloading with passive searches. It means you have to wait
  	some time before you can start a successive new search.
  	Make sure you don't have 
    <a href="settings_queue.html#autosearchdl">
    Automatically Search for Alternative Download Locations</a>
    enabled in Queue settings if you are in a hub of this kind
    as it could prevent you to get manual search results.</li> 	
</ol>
<h2>If you are unable to search on all hubs</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you use one of the active connection modes, enter your external 
  	<acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym> address
to the <i>External/WAN IP</i> field in the <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">
Connection settings dialog</a> and try to search again. 
Find out the IP from <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/ip" target="_blank"
 class="external">DSLReport's IP page</a>.</li>
  <li>Check your router/gateway/firewall configuration. You need to make sure
it's allowing or forwarding incoming connections on the port specified in
the settings. You have to enable both <acronym
 title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</acronym> and <acronym
 title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</acronym> traffic. If you can
download, but not search, UDP is blocked. Please read the 
<a href="faq_connection.html">Connection setup guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Your school or work might be blocking DC traffic. Read the FAQ on
types of blocks, and what you <a href="faq_university.html">might be
able to do about it</a>.</li>
  <li>If the above things don't work for you, you'll have to use
passive mode (if the hub allows it).</li>
  <li>
If you still can't search (in passive mode) then probably your DC++
blocked by a software firewall. Please follow the 
<a href="faq_unblock.html">guide how to unblock DC++ in firewalls and 
other types of security sofware</a>. </li>
<li>
An anti-flood protector software / network device can (partially)
block your searches as well. You can suspect that you have a problem 
of this kind when you always get few results even if you
searched for a common term. You can read more about this topic in the 
<a href="faq_slowdownload.html#ddos">Slow downloads FAQ</a>.</li>
