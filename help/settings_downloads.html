<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>This page contains the configuration options for where DC++ will
place complete and incomplete downloads, options that control the
maximum simultaneous downloads, and information on the public hub list
that DC++ will use.</p>
<h2>Directories</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Default download directory</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADDIR">After a download is complete, DC++ tries to move your
just finished file to this directory. It defaults to the
"Downloads\" subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located. The directory will be automatically created if needed.
<br/>Make sure you have enough disk space for your downloads, have write access to the directory and 
have an appropriate file system if you download large files (note that maximum possible size for a 
file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB).
<br/>If the target volume runs out of space, DC++ will keep your downloaded files in the Unfinished Downloads Directory
having renamed them to their original filename.
</dd>
  <dt>Unfinished downloads directory</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_TEMP_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY">
  All incomplete downloads will be stored in this directory.
If you leave it empty, temporary downloads will be stored in the "Incomplete\"
subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located. The directory will be automatically created if needed.
<br/>Make sure you have enough disk space, appropriate write access and filesystem for unfinished downloads. From version 0.706 DC++ always use antifragmentation method for downloads so it will try to reserve the full space needed for a file
when starting the download. In case of an error (eg. when the drive that holds your Unfinished Downloads ran out of space) you will
get 'Not enough space on the disk' message even if your target drive has enough free space for your download!
If the file has been downloaded the incomplete file will bear the name &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;.&lt;TTH&gt;.dctmp.
<p>You can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">%[targetdrive]</span> for optional unfinished directory for all target
drives. This way you can share the incomplete files among your drives which will result a smaller chance of runnig out of disk space.
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Example</span> : when %[targetdrive]DCUnfinished\ set as unfinished directory, DC++ will create incomplete files in E:\DCUnfinished\
when you download to any target folder located on drive E: and so on...
<br/>%[targetrive] option is also useful if you often download larger files to a drive other than where your usual unfinished directory 
resides. At the end of a successful download, moving a large file from the unifinshed folder to its target could be very
time and resource consuming, especially when moving files to another partition of the same physical drive.</p>

<h2>Limits</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_LIMITS">These settings are to avoid overloading your internet connection with
a large number of simulatenous downloads. However, for both values listed below, certain conditions can result in the
limits not being obeyed. Specifically, up to 3 files that are set
to the 'highest' priority can be transferred while other downloads are
going. File lists and small files (64 kibibytes or
smaller) are queued with 'highest' as their priority. When either
of the limits are hit, DC++ shows <em>"All download slots taken"</em>
next to each source in the status column of the Connections tab.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Maximum simultaneous downloads (0 = infinite)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADS">This limits the number of simultaneous downloads.
A value of 0 means no limit. (default: 3)</dd>
  <dt>No new downloads if speed exceeds (KiB/s, 0 = disable)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_MAXSPEED">This is another method of limiting simultaneous downloads,
designed to prevent new downloads if your existing downloads exceed a
specific threshold. It's measured in kibibytes per second, and a
value of zero will disable this limit. <div
 style="font-style: italic;">Note; because of changing download speeds, this is not 100% accurate...</div></dd>

  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_PROXY">This HTTP proxy will <span style="text-decoration: underline">only</span> be used to request the Public
Hub List specified above. It's <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> used for uploads,
