<h2>Private chat window (top)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_CHAT">
The private chat window displays messages sent during your private conversation with a specific user (to know which one, take a look at the title bar of the main DC++ window). You can chat with the other user in this "private area" by writing a message in the field below the private chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).
</p>
<p>Click on links (URLs that start with https://, ftp://, www, etc) shown in the chat window to
open them with the registered browser/viewer software.</p>

<h2>Field to write a message (bottom)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_MESSAGE">
<div>
Write a message here to chat with the user you are currently in private conversation with (to know which one, take a look at the title bar of the main DC++ window). You can press either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).

When composing a multiline message, this box resizes itself automatically according to the <placeholder><a href="settings_appearance.html#messagelines">Height of the message editing box</a></placeholder> settings.
</div>

<h2>Status bar</h2>

<h3>Message part (left)</h3>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_STATUS">
Shows the most recent status message.<br/>
To see more from the recent status messages you can move the mouse pointer above the status bar - the last few messages will be shown as a tooltip shortly.
</p>

<h3>Communication channel</h3>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_CHANNEL">
Private messages are usually sent through a hub, the name of which is indicated here. This part can
also show "<placeholder>Direct encrypted channel</placeholder>" when private messages flow directly
between you and the user (no hub involved in that case).<br/>
Click this part to select the desired communication channel.
</p>

<h2 id="ccpm">Information on direct encrypted private message channels</h2>
<p>
Hubs can spy upon any private message they may be involved in routing from one user to another. In
order to avoid such spying, one can initiate a peer-to-peer connection with the desired user and
use it to send private messages.<br/>
The hub used to establish the initial peer-to-peer connection must be an ADC hub and the connection
between the user and the hub must be encrypted ("adcs" scheme instead of "adc"). Additionally, both
users must support the "CCPM" ADC extension.<br/>
Ways to attempt a direct encrypted channel:
<ul>
	<li>Click the "Communication channel" part of the status bar and select the
	"<placeholder>Start a direct encrypted channel</placeholder>" menu command.</li>
	<li>Send the "/direct" chat command.</li>
	<li>Send the "/encrypted" chat command.</li>
</ul>
Ways to disconnect the direct encrypted channel:
<ul>
	<li>Click the "Communication channel" part of the status bar and select the
	"<placeholder>Disconnect the direct encrypted channel</placeholder>" menu command.</li>
	<li>Click the "Communication channel" part of the status bar and select a hub.</li>
	<li>Close the private message window.</li>
	<li>Disconnect the transfer from the
	<placeholder><a href="window_transfers.html">Transfers</a></placeholder> list.</li>
</ul>
