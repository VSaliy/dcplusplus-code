<h2>Private chat window (top)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_CHAT">
The private chat window displays messages sent during your private conversation with a specific user (to know which one, take a look at the title bar of the main DC++ window). You can chat with the other user in this "private area" by writing a message in the field below the private chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).
</p>
<p>Double-click on links (that start with http://, ftp://, www, etc) shown in the chat window to
open them with the registered browser/viewer software.</p>
