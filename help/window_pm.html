<h1>Private Message</h1>
<h2>Private chat window (top)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_CHAT">
The private chat window displays messages sent during your private conversation with a specific user (to know which one, take a look at the title bar of the main DC++ window). You can chat with the other user in this "private area" by writing a message in the field below the private chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).
</p>
<h2>Field to write a message (bottom)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_PM_MESSAGE">
Write a message here to chat with the user you are currently in private conversation with (to know which one, take a look at the title bar of the main DC++ window). You can press either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).
</p>
<h2>Status bar</h2>
<p>
Shows the most recent status message.<br/>
If private chat <a href="settings_logs.html">logging</a> is enabled and if the <a href="settings_expert.html#pmhistory">PM history</a> setting is not zero, also contains the latest lines of the previous conversation you have had with that user when this PM window is opened, since these log messages are sent to the status bar.<br/>
To see more from the recent status messages you can move the mouse pointer above the status bar - the last few messages will be shown as a tooltip shortly.
