"Universal Plug And Play (UPnP) is a technology to allow, among other things, "
"Internet applications to configure home routers and gateways, bypassing "
"manual port forwarding configuration. UPnP was introduced in Windows XP and "
"is supported in that and later versions, including Windows Server and Vista. "
"To take advantage of UPnP, you must have support enabled in Windows and UPnP "
"capable hardware (typically a broadband router using <acronym po4a-id=0>NAT</"
"acronym> traversal). If you meet both of these requirements, setting up DC++ "
"is normally a simple process. <b>UPnP support introduced in DC++ 0.4033</b>. "
"For using DC++ with UPnP <b>under Vista you need version 0.695 or newer</b>."
