<h1>Indexing progress</h1>
<p>
This window will display what file is currently being indexed (hashed) by DC++, at what rate and approximately how long time there is left.
</p>
<p>
With this window open, DC++ will index at the priority level of "normal". If DC++ index in the background, the priority level is "lowest" (below "normal"). The priority level affect how much access time DC++ should get for indexing files. A higher priority mean that DC++ will index more frequent, but will also put on more strain on the computer and it will possibly perform slower.
</p>
<p>
You can pause and then resume hashing at any time using the button on the bottom right. Pressing the button may won't pause the indexing at once, it will finish the files currently beeing indexed. When hashing large files or directories it may take up to a minute to stop the operation completely.
</p>
<p>
Note that files will not be shared until they are indexed.
