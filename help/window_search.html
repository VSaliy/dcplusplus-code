<h1>Search</h1>
<p>The Search window make possible searching for files in shares of the users of the connected hubs. You can provide 
one or more keywords and optionally set some search filters described below and press the Search button to start a search.
DC++ will send out the search request to the hub(s) you are connected and they will pass the request to all clients. </p>
<p>When a client matches a serach request it'll send the results to the requester. The results will be displayed in the 
search results list of the Search window.</p>
<p>You can open several Search windows and you can define search keywords and set filters independently so you
are able to start multiple searches simultaneously. However <b>search requests are sent out only once, when the Search
button pressed</b>. After that - until the button pressed again - a Search window only listens for and displays search results.
(It means that those clients who logged in <i>after</i> you pressed the Search button won't send you search results until
you repeat the search.)</p>
<p>You may not start or repeat searches as soon as you like. There is a few seconds of minimum interval between two searches
defined in DC++. You will get a countdown message in the Status bar if you try to search sooner than allowed 
and you are able to repeat the search only when the client is ready for search again. Hubs may also limit searches by checking
for forbidden keywords or blocking repeated searches for the same terms in a certain amount of time. Some hubs have
predefined minimum search intervals for all searches or they even totally block searches if you are in 
<a href="settings_connection.html#connection">passive mode</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if you search on NMDC hubs, results are transferred to all open Search windows. The windows
then display only those results that match their search criteria. So when a similar search sent out from a new Search window,
its normal that some hits displayed in some other Search windows opened before. The number of hits filtered out are shown 
in the status bar of every window. In case of searches on ADC hubs every Search window will pick its own search results only.</p>
<p>Search hits with TTH are always matched to the Download queue and the new sources are automatically added to the queue items
unless they are removed or marked as "bad" sources before. The filelists of all newly discovered sources will be automatically
matched for possible other queued files if <a href="settings_queue.html#automatchqueue">Automatically match queue for search hits</a>
setting is enabled. This can generate lots of filelist traffic when large amount of new sources are found for queued files.</p>

<p>If you often get too few search results or no results at all, refer to the <a href="faq_nosearch.html">Search troubleshooting FAQ.</a></p>
