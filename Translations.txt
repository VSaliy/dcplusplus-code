This document briefly describes the DC++ translation process.
Translations currently happen in Launchpad <https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus>.

1) Creating translation templates
2) Updating translations

--- 1) Creating translation templates ---

Translation templates are .pot files. Update them with:

	scons i18n=1 dcpp/po/libdcpp.pot help/po/dcpp-help.pot installer/po/dcpp-installer.pot win32/po/dcpp-win32.pot

Then commit them with:

	bzr ci
	bzr push

Launchpad should then update the translation templates by itself.

Send a message to <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dcplusplus-devel> to announce it.

--- 2) Updating translations ---

Download PO files from <https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus/trunk/+export>.

Extract them to a directory, say C:/trans.

Open a Cygwin command prompt in the scripts directory of the DC++ repo. Merge new translations:

	./update-languages.sh C:/trans

[If running scons from Cygwin is a problem, temporarily remove the scons call in
update-languages.sh, call that scons command manually then run the script.]

Check updated and new translations with:

	bzr status

Ensure new translations are correct (recently updated). Use "bzr add" to add them if they are;
otherwise, delete them.

Make sure updated languages build fine; eg for the "fr" language:

	scons i18n=1 build/debug-mingw/bin/locale/fr

Commit new translations:

	bzr ci
	bzr push
