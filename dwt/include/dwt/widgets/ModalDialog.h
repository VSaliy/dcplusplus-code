/** \ingroup WidgetControls
  * \image html dialog.PNG
  * Class for creating a Modal Dialog based optionally on an embedded resource. <br>
  * Use create( unsigned resourceId ) if you define the dialog in a .rc file,
  * and use create() if you define the dialog completly in C++ source. <br>
  * Use the create function to actually create a dialog. <br>
  * Class is a public superclass of Frame and therefore can use all
  * features of Frame. <br>
  * Note! <br>
  * Usually you create a ModalDialog on the stack. <br>
  * This Widget does NOT have selfdestructive semantics and should normally be
  * constructed on the stack! <br>
  * The create function does NOT return before the Widget is destroyed! <br>
  * Thus, you must declare the "onInitDialog" event handler before calling the
  * "create()", either in the contructor, or in some intialization routine
  * called before create();
